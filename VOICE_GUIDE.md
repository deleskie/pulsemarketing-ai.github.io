# Pulse Marketing AI Voice Guide

This guide documents how we write marketing copy (especially long-form chronicles) for the Pulse Marketing AI site. Keep it handy when drafting or reviewing new material.

## Audience
- Experiential hospitality teams, multi-brand retail collectives, creative agencies, and cultural venues designing cinematic launches.
- Typical revenue band: roughly \$50k–\$250k per month per flagship location. They juggle production partners, compliance, and storytelling while protecting margins.

## Tone and Style
- Confident, luminous, and operator-forward. Sound like a seasoned producer who has run launch control rooms and respects frontline craft.
- Avoid empty hype. Pair bold phrasing with receipts—metrics, anecdotes, or guest quotes.
- Use plain English with a cinematic cadence. Mix short, punchy lines with longer sentences that build atmosphere.
- Celebrate wins without erasing the work. Tie benefits to resonance, guest delight, or accountable growth.

## Structure
- Chronicles should land between 3,000 and 3,500 words unless otherwise noted.
- Aim for 20–30 paragraphs. Target 4–6 sentences per paragraph to avoid the “AI bite-sized” feel.
- Open with a vivid scene or moment-in-progress. Close with an action-oriented insight or an invitation to co-create.
- Whenever you introduce an important claim, follow with a “why it matters” explanation rooted in operational reality.

## Repetition and Coverage
- Track themes we have already explored—Resonance Rooms, Storyteller, Signal Ateliers, Momentum Mechanics, Infinity Loop—before outlining.
- When revisiting a topic, bring a fresh lens: a new customer story, updated metric, partner collaboration, or emerging regulation.

## Disclaimers
- Every blog post ends with: “Stories are inspired by typical customer situations; names and details are fictional.”
- If a post references specific companies, platforms, or competitors, add the second line: “Comparisons and company references are hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only.” Set `includeCompetitorDisclaimer: true` on that post in `blogPosts.ts`.

## Vocabulary Notes
- Use “guests” or “patrons” for physical experiences, “members” for recurring programs, and “clients” for agency engagements.
- Refer to the product as “Pulse Marketing AI” on first mention, “Pulse” afterward. The AI narrator remains “Storyteller”.
- Keep metrics grounded and round (e.g., “+26% suite upgrades” instead of “+25.87%”).

## Future Automation
- When we automate chronicle generation, inject these guardrails into prompts:
  - Target persona and venue archetype.
  - Desired length (3,000–3,500 words) and paragraph density.
  - Requirement to pair claims with “why it matters” context.
  - Disclaimer rules based on competitor or vendor references.
