# Pulse Marketing AI (Static Site)

This branch hosts the compiled assets that GitHub Pages serves for https://www.pulsemarketing-ai.com/.

The editable source lives on the `source` branch (`npm create vite@latest` scaffold). To update the site:

1. Switch to the `source` branch and make changes.
2. Run `npm install` (once) and `npm run build`.
3. Copy the `dist/` output into the `main` branch root and commit.

Alternatively use the deploy script or automation if you prefer to keep build artifacts in sync automatically.
